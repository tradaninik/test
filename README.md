# Metabolic Intelligence Platform

A personal metabolic intelligence system that continuously learns how each individual
responds to food, sleep, activity, stress, medication, and lifestyle factors — focused on
diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, fatty liver disease, and preventive
health.

> **Non-clinical / educational.** All predictions and recommendations are produced by an
> explainable, deterministic engine and are **not medical advice**. Always consult a
> qualified healthcare professional for medical decisions.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install            # installs all workspaces
npm run db:push        # creates the local SQLite database
npm run db:seed        # loads regional food DB + sample user
npm run dev            # starts the web app at http://localhost:3000
npm test               # runs the engine test suite (Vitest)
```

## What's where

```
apps/web/        Next.js 15 web app (the deployable product)
